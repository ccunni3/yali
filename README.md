## Acknowledgement

This project was inspired by Casbin. I also want to thank the folks who spent countless hours designing open specifications for attribute based role control.

## Onomastic Explaination

I was inspired by the several examples of mythological creatures that protect entry or access to physical places while thinking of what to name the project. These mythical creatures often symbolize protection, strength, and the boundaries between different realms, serving as guardians of the physical and spiritual spaces they inhabit.

> In Hindu mythology, the Yali is a mythical creature with the body of a lion or a tiger and the head of another animal, often an elephant. Yalis are frequently depicted as guardians of entrances to temples and other sacred places in South India.
